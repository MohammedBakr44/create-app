# create app
_couldn't find a better name_.

This is a CLI app that help you create a simple boilerplate web apps. without wasting time going through environoment setup.

# General setup

This CLI uses the 7-1 technique in sass, maybe I'll add it to pug too, but now it's just for sass. And it's my own project structure.

# gulp

I created it with my personal config for gulp, I think it could help anyone. I wrote this config to watch and compile Pug, Sass, TS files so I'm sure it could help.

# Parcel

Parcel needs no config, so it was easy to write code for it.

# Notes

* I'm not too good in bash, so don't expect something in the quality of Linus Trovalds' code, I created it to save my time and posted it...as a backup xD, but I hope it help someone.

* Options available through create-app -h
